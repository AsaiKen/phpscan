# Contribution process
Your help is most appreciated, and improves experience for everyone, but **we are legally obliged to get a contributor license agreement for any change**. You have to send a photo of signed [Contributor agreement] before we'll be able to include your contribution into the product and redistribute to other users. See link for explanation. 

# Notes on content
Please link pull request/commit messages to [YT] issue and back if such issue exists.

##Code Style
* Please avoid any unnecessary changes eg. spacing, line endings, HTML formatting. Remember, these files are NOT for human consumption. We want to preserve meaningful history.
* Please try to match existing style for any particular file - formatting, spacing, naming conventions.

##Types of contribution
We don't really want to include all possible extension/libs ASAP (they do slow the IDE down a bit) and we are working on a better system for managing them. **Until we find good solution we'll prioritise bugfixes**.
